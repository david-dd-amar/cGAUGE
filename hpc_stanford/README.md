1. run_full_simulations_on_sherlock.R - a script that runs all simulations presented in the paper involving MR methods with and without cGAUGE.

2. ukbb_trait_skeleton_inference.R - inference of the skeleton of a set of traits (e.g., from the UK-Biobank). 

      2.1. analyze_trait_pair_for_skeleton.R - a helper runnable script for analyzing a single trait pair.

4. run_mrpresso_on_pair.R - a simple wrapper for running MR-PRESSO on a single exposure-outcome pair.

5. run_edge_sep_test_for_pair.R -  a simple test for edge separation based evidence for a causal link.
